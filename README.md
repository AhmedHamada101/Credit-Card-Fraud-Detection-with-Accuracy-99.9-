### Note:
* <h>In the case of credit card fraud detection, we want to avoid false negatives as much as possible. Fraud transactions cost us a lot and thus we want to take appropriate measures to prevent them. A false negative case means that a fraud-positive transaction is assessed as a genuine transaction, which is detrimental.</h>
